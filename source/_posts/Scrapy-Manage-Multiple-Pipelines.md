It's a common situation that managing multiple pipelines are required  when we try to develop some scrapy projects and decide the order of the pipelines. 

What's worse, there may be not only one spider in the porject, and each  spider own different requirements to the project pipelines. And there is no doubt that **effective management of pipelines can greatly improve our efficiency** which is also the purpose of this article.
